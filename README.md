This repository, mainly built around Computational Finance in Python, is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks categorized into folders sharing the same concepts.

# 1. Assets Allocation and Portfolio Optimization

In this section, I have implemented two concepts about Assets Allocation:

    - Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio using Monte Carlo Simulation
## Maximum Sharp Ratio Portfolio

# 2. Financial Machine Learning

TBD

# 3. Monte Carlo Simulation
